Basic JSON format to describe the book and all of its sections.  Each section may define a `type`, defaulting to _chapter_.  This is taken literally as a HTMLBook data-type for the section.  Either a `contents` file or a list of subsections must be defined.  If sections are given inside of a `chapter` the default `type` becomes normal sections.  If a title is not supplied for a chapter, it is taken from the first section header.
