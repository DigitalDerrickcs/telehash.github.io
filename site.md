## homepage

Notes:

* mimic flow of [haskell.org](https://www.haskell.org) with header, try, features, and community sections
* avoid deep technical talk, the spec and tech is a click away
* put "philosophy" paragraph on team intro, link to from the what/intro
* use a single-page design, sticky header bar of the sections below w/ auto-scrolling

Feature sections expand:

* industry
  * IoT
  * Communication
  * Commerce
  * Gaming
* developers
  * implementations
  * demos
  * protocol
* privacy
  * end-to-end
  * hashnames
  * multi-transport (layered/combined)
* standards
  * e3x
  * mesh-link
  * JOSE
  * blockchain

## What

Telehash is a lightweight secure mesh networking protocol that enables applications and devices to connect reliably in any environment with no central authority.  It can work atop traditional Internet connections, mobile, local area Bluetooth/Wifi, and even embedded sensor mesh networks. The specification is openly published and collaboratively developed, and all of the implementations are open source.

## Industry

As a networking technology telehash can be used anywhere, but there are four industries that benefit significantly from the security and decentralized aspects of the protocol.

### Internet of Things

The inevitable increase in small networked devices is bringing with it serious challenges in managing the data and security as a result.

The design of telehash includes being able to operate securely on tiny low-power devices, and enable the types of bridging and relaying required for deploying multiple wireless technologies and energy requirements.

### Communication

The need for privacy in our communication technologies has never been more important, and it fundamentally must begin with moving data from person to person, end to end, always encrypted.  The principles of telehash are to enable this device-to-device private communication as primary goal.

### Commerce

Bitcoin and blockchain-based technologies are fueling a new generation of online commerce and distributed digital value innovations, and often these transactions are either sent insecurely or limited to server-based encryption.  Telehash enables any two parties to both send the transactions encrypted directly as well as facilitate private communication to negotiate or deliver assets related to transactions.

### Gaming

Gaming is now a fundamental part of everyone's lives with the increased accessibility of low cost compute and display technology, and games are evolving to become more social and networked as a result.

The challenges in providing reliable real-time connectivity using the current network technologies in building a multi-user game is a significant part of the development process, and telehash fundamentally solves a number of those problems including local discovery, security, and multi-network reliability.
