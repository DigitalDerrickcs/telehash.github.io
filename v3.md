V3 Proposal Changelog
=====================

> see discussion at
> https://github.com/telehash/telehash.org/issues/57

* vocabulary - renaming core concepts
  * `open` to `handshake`
  * `line` to `exchange`
  * `line id` to `token`
  * `seed` to `router`
  * `switch` is not used anymore
* handshake - wire changes
  * binary/outer packet must contain the IV
  * one temporary key is used per exchange per sender, the IV changes for each handshake
  * the inner `at` value must have the least-significant-bit set to it's channnel id base (to prevent conflicts)
  * the highest received `at` must always be returned/confirmed in a response handshake for the exchange to be valid
  * handshakes are sent throughout the life of the exchange to verify it's current validity, as needed by the network transport in use
* exchange packets
  * the first 16 bytes are always referenced as the `token` and uniquely identify a destination exchange for any routing purposes
* [E3X](E3X.md) - common internal library interface
  * all wire protocol processing and generation is *cleanly* separated from higher level logic
  * encapsulation of all crypto functions
  * single clearly understood location of all trust decisions
* network transports - increase the types of transports supported by default
  * TLS
  * Tor
  * I2P
  * make use of NAT-PMP / UPnP
  * push notifications
  * BLE
* [telehash](telehash.md) - higher level interoperable library with easy interface
  * manages routers and maintains links to any hashname
  * handles all E3X and transport work internally
  * exposes native stream and socket interfaces
  * WS API
  * HTTP proxy
  * supports discoverable/pairing mode for local transports

### DHT

V3 no longer includes a DHT, which has long been a core part of the definition of telehash.  The changes during 2013/2014 for V2 to focus on privacy have created a tension between the desire to have zero metadata visible to be monitored and the needs of a DHT.  The mission to provide easy *End-to-End* private communication tools is paramount, and no identifying information should be visible to any untrusted entity by default.  Reducing the scope of telehash is also intended to increase it's compatibility with other decentralized private networking tools like I2P/Tor and be used easily within existing encrypted transports like TLS and WebRTC.

A DHT provides coordination between large numbers of decentralized nodes, and that is a use case that V3 is explicitly not solving as it provides communication between *small* numbers of *trusted* nodes.  As the number of nodes increases, so does the risk of survelence of which nodes are communicating, and V3 exists to minimize that potential.
