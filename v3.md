V3 Proposal Changelog
=====================

> see discussion at
> https://github.com/telehash/telehash.org/issues/57

* vocabulary - renaming core concepts
  * `open` to `handshake`
  * `line` to `exchange`
  * `line id` to `token`
  * `seed` to `router`
  * `switch` is not used anymore
  * `DHT` to `mesh`
* handshake - wire changes
  * binary/outer packet must contain the IV
  * one temporary key is used per exchange per sender, the IV changes for each handshake
  * channel id base is selected based on the comparison of the public key being used (not the hashname)
  * the inner `at` value must have it's last digit set to it's channnel id base (0 or 1, to prevent conflicts)
  * the highest received `at` must always be returned/confirmed in a response handshake for the exchange to be valid
  * handshakes are sent throughout the life of the exchange to verify it's current validity, as needed by the network transport in use
* exchange packets
  * the first 16 bytes are always referenced as the `token` and uniquely identify a destination exchange for any routing purposes
* [E3X](E3X.md) - common internal library interface
  * all wire protocol processing and generation is *cleanly* separated from higher level logic
  * encapsulation of all crypto functions
  * single clearly understood location of all trust decisions
* network transports - increase the types of transports supported by default
  * TLS
  * Tor
  * I2P
  * make use of NAT-PMP / UPnP
  * push notifications
  * BLE
* hashname
  * use base58 encoding to a string instead of hex
  * use raw byte values during the rollup instead of hex strings
  * parts are always the SHA256 of the normalied public key 
* [telehash](telehash.md) - higher level interoperable library with easy interface
  * manages routers and maintains links to any hashname
  * handles all E3X and transport work internally
  * exposes native stream and socket interfaces
  * WS API
  * HTTP proxy
  * supports discoverable/pairing mode for local transports
* channel changes
  * seek is not used
  * link does not contain `see` or `seed` and is not used to a router
  * peer/connect is simple relay, always reflects back current path, can include token to signal/create bridge


### DHT

V3 no longer includes a Kademlia-based Distributed Hash Table and is instead is a simple full mesh protocol that requires mutual explicit trust to connect with support for optional cloud-accelerated routing in any mesh.

The changes during 2013/2014 for V2 to focus on privacy have created a tension between the desire to have zero metadata exposed and how a DHT uses untrusted peers to coordinate connectivity.  The mission to provide easy *End-to-End* private communication tools is paramount, and no identifying information should be visible to any untrusted entity by default.  Reducing the scope of telehash is also intended to increase it's compatibility with other decentralized private networking tools like I2P/Tor and so that it can be used easily within existing encrypted transports like TLS and WebRTC.

A DHT is a tool to provide coordination between *large* numbers of decentralized nodes, and our focus for V3 is to enable private communication between *small* numbers of *trusted* nodes.  As the number of nodes increases, so does the risk of surveillance of which nodes are communicating, and V3 aims to minimize that potential.
