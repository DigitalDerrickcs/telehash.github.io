V3 Proposal Changelog
=====================

> see discussion at
> https://github.com/telehash/telehash.org/issues/57

* vocabulary - renaming core concepts
  * `open` to `handshake`
  * `line` to `exchange`
  * `line id` to `token`
  * `seed` to `router`
  * `switch` is not used anymore
* handshake - wire changes
  * binary/outer packet must contain the IV
  * one temporary key is used per exchange per sender, the IV changes for each handshake
  * the inner `at` value must have the least-significant-bit set to it's channnel id base (to prevent conflicts)
  * the highest received `at` must always be returned/confirmed in a response handshake for the exchange to be valid
  * handshakes are sent throughout the life of the exchange to verify it's current validity, as needed by the network transport in use
* exchange packets
  * the first 16 bytes are always referenced as the `token` and uniquely identify a destination exchange for any routing purposes
* [E3X](E3X.md) - common internal library interface
  * all wire protocol processing and generation is *cleanly* separated from higher level logic
  * encapsulation of all crypto functions
  * single clearly understood location of all trust decisions
* network transports - increase the types of transports supported by default
  * TLS
  * Tor
  * I2P
  * make use of NAT-PMP / UPnP
  * push notifications
  * BLE
* [telehash](telehash.md) - higher level interoperable library with easy interface
  * manages routers and maintains links to any hashname
  * handles all E3X and transport work internally
  * exposes native stream and socket interfaces
  * WS API
  * HTTP proxy
  * supports discoverable/pairing mode for local transports
