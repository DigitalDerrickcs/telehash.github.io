# Introduction

Telehash is a new secure wire protocol that creates a decentralized overlay network, enabling apps and devices to
find, identify, and communicate directly with each other.  It is built
on public-key security (PKI) and fundamentally creates mesh of peer-to-peer
(P2P) connections using a distributed hash-table (DHT).

The principle idea that drove the creation and development of Telehash
is the belief that any application instance should be able to easily and
securely talk to any other application instance or device, whether they are two
instances of the same application, or completely different
applications. They should be able to do so directly, and in any
environment, from servers to mobile devices down to embedded systems
and sensors.

By enabling this freedom for developers as a foundation for their
applications, Telehash enables the same freedom for the people using
them - that the user can connect, share, and communicate more easily
and with control of their privacy.

The challenges and complexity today in connecting applications via
existing technologies such as APIs, OAuth, and REST is only increasing,
often forcing fundamentally insecure, centralized, and closed/gated
communication platforms.  By adopting Telehash in any application, that
application immediately has a powerful set of open tools for not only
its own needs, but can then also enable connectivity to and from
applications created by others easily. These tools include the ability
to have friends, sharing, feeds, tagging, search, notifications,
discovery, and other social patterns.

Telehash has a fundamental requirement to remain simple and
light-weight in order to support applications running on networked
devices and sensors. The design goals also include not forcing any
particular architectural design such as client-server,
centralized/federated/distributed, polling/push, REST, streaming,
publish-subscribe, or message passing... any can be used, as Telehash
simply facilitates secure reliable connectivity between any two or more
applications in any networking environment.
