# Channels

Telehash defines a set of standard channels for implementations to support for interoperable built-in functionality.

The standard channels all use common simple names, so any application or library supporting a custom channel should use a [Collision-Resistant Name](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-41#section-2): a name in a namespace that enables names to be allocated in a manner such that they are highly unlikely to collide with other names.

The current list of active and draft channels can always be found on [github](https://github.com/telehash/telehash.org/tree/master/v3/channels).
