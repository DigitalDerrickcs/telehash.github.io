Cipher Set 1b
=============

> DRAFT - [Work In Progress](https://github.com/telehash/telehash.org/issues/42)

This is just a placeholder to define a hardware-accelerated friendly embedded CS.

-----------------

The base algorithms used in this set are chosen to be supported by commonly available hardware-accelerated-crypto on embedded hardware.

* **ECC NIST-P256**
* **HMAC-SHA256**
* **AES-128-CTR**
