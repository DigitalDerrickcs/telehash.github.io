Cipher Set 2a
=============

This profile is based on the algorithms used during the telehash development process in 2013.

The required algorithms in this set are:

* **RSA 2048** - selected as a well known and highly trusted public key algorithm and size, used as the long-lived identity
* **ECC P-256** - a well known curve with many implementations, used for the ephemeral identity
* **AES 256-GCM** - trusted common implementations available

## Keys

When generating an endpoint including `CS2a`, the public/private keypair is [RSA 2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)).

Binary public keys are encoded in [DER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Encoding_Rules) as X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo structures.  (Most cryptographic libraries support this encoding; see [RFC 5280 section 4.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.1) and [RFC 3279 section 2.3.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3279#section-2.3.1) for more details.) 

The exchange ephemeral key is generated using [ECC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography) and the [p-256](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/documents/dss/NISTReCur.pdf) curve, the resulting binary public key is [uncompressed](https://www.secg.org/collateral/sec1_final.pdf) (65 bytes).


## Message BODY

BODY bytes:

* `KEY` - 256 bytes, PKCS1 [OAEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_asymmetric_encryption_padding) (v2) RSA encrpyted ciphertext of the 65 byte uncompressed ECC P-256 ephemeral public key
* `IV` - 4 bytes, a random but unique value determined by the sender for each message
* `CIPHERTEXT` - [AES-256-GCM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) encrypted inner packet and sender signature
* `MAC` - 16 bytes, GCM 128-bit MAC/tag digest (some GCM implementations auto-append this)

The `CIPHERTEXT` once deciphered contains:

* `INNER` - inner packet raw bytes
* `SIG` - 256 bytes, PKCS1 v1.5 RSA signature of the KEY+INNER

The KEY is created by generating a new ephemeral elliptic (ECC) public key for this exchange and using the endpoint's RSA key to encrypt it *to* the recipient's RSA public key. The ECC keypair should be generated using the P-256 ([nistp256/secp256r/X9.62 prime256v1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6239#page-4)) curve. The key should be in the uncompressed form 65 bytes in length (ANSI X9.63 format). The RSA encryption should use PKCS1 OAEP (v2) padding. The result is always padded to 256 bytes by OAEP.

The SIG is calculated by first concatenating the `KEY` (256 bytes of ciphertext) and `INNER` (raw packet) together, and then using the sender's RSA public key (SHA-256 hash and PKCS1 v1.5 padding) to create a signature of it, resulting in a 256 byte `SIG` value.

The `CIPHERTEXT` is created by encrypting the `INNER` and `SIG` (concatenated together) using AES-256-GCM.  The GCM IV/nonce parameter is the 4 byte `IV` value and the key parameter is is the SHA-256 32 byte digest output from hashing the 65 byte ECC public key (result of the RSA decryption of the `KEY` value). The "tag" size for GCM is 16 bytes (128 bits), and the additional/auth data used to compute it is the 256 `KEY` bytes, resulting in the `MAC` value appended to the original packet.


## Channel Setup

The channel encryption/decryption secret keys are generated by using [ECDH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffieâ€“Hellman) with the local ephemeral ECC private key, and the remote ephemeral ECC public key. Two secret keys are generated by performing a SHA-256 with the derived ECDH derived secret (32 bytes) and sent/received decrypted `KEY` values (65 bytes each):

* line encryption key: SHA256(ecdh-secret, sent-ecc-key, received-ecc-key)
* line decryption key: SHA256(ecdh-secret, received-ecc-key, sent-ecc-key)

## Channel BODY

Channel packet binary `BODY` is defined as:

* `TOKEN` - 16 bytes, from the handshake, required for all channel packets
* `IV` - 16 bytes, random per packet
* `CHANNEL CIPHERTEXT` - the AES-256-GCM encrypted channel packet
* `GCM TAG/MAC` - (GMAC) - 16 bytes, GCM MAC digest (some GCM libraries auto-append this with the AES-256-GCM cipher output)

The IV is 16 random bytes generated for every channel packet sent and used as the input to the GCM calculation, along with the appropriate encryption/decryption keys calculated for the exchange.  The tag size for GCM is 16 bytes (128 bits) and no additiona/auth data is included as input to it.
