HTTP Transport
==============

Any endpoint may support a `http` path to maximize connectivity.  This is specifically useful when running inside a browser, or when an app needs to operate inside a highly restricted network that offers only HTTP/HTTPS.

This path is implemented using [socket.io](http://socket.io) (which handles all of the fallback and reconnect logic), and the only information needed to be exchanged is a `url` that can be `http://` or `https://`.

The `socket.io` interface is a minimal "msg" event being generated by either side, with it's argument being a single binary string of the packet.
