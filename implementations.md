# Implementations

In order to use telehash in an application, the application will need to include a software layer that talks to the network, handles the encryption, and processes packets.  This software is known as a "switch" and may come in the form of a library, module, or SDK depending on your language/platform.

It is highly recommended to use an existing implementation for your environment rather than creating one from scratch. This will help ensure that the security, identity, and networking aspects are verified properly. If there isn't one which meets your needs, then please see the [Implementers Guide](implementers.md).
