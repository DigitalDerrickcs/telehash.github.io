# 802.15.4

There is an effort just beginning to have Telehash operate as a native mesh network protocol above [802.15.4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4). The goal is for it to follow the same seed, discovery, and low-power link maintenance for local-scale DHT operations.

Any device supporting this transport where there is a seed on the network that can bridge to any other network transport (including Wifi (UDP), Bluetooth, etc) will be able to securely connect with any other hashname.
