IP <> Telehash Bindings
=======================

> This document is only a stub, please use the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/telehash/telehash.org/issues/30) for discussion

IP traffic can be tunneled between two hashnames with the packets being attached as the BODY payload on a custom channel.

Switches supporting this can create a TUN interface to act as the local gateway.
